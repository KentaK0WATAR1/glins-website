  <!-- ===== Introduction ===== -->
<section class="alt">
  <div class="container"> 
  <h3 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">What&nbsp;is&nbsp;GLINS?</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      The <strong>GLINS (Global Logistics Intermodal Network Simulation)</strong> model was
      developed to help policymakers and practitioners understand and evaluate
      international logistics flows in an increasingly interconnected world. As
      maritime container transport has globalized, it has become essential to
      analyze not just shipping routes but also the wider hinterland networks that
      connect ports to inland destinations.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Since its inception, GLINS has evolved through applications in diverse regions
      and contexts, responding to specific policy needs and incorporating new
      features along the way. Initially focused on maritime networks alone, it has
      progressively expanded to include hinterland congestion, land freight, air
      cargo, and even non-containerized cargo. It has also introduced multi-stage
      allocation to better represent complex logistics decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Over the past decade, GLINS has been applied in Central America, South and
      Southeast Asia, Central and East Africa, Eurasia, Japan, the Pacific Islands,
      and the Arctic region. These applications have addressed challenges such as
      prioritizing infrastructure investments, evaluating policy options, optimizing
      routes under capacity and congestion constraints, and assessing the viability
      of new shipping routes like the Arctic sea route, where seasonal conditions
      significantly affect costs and accessibility.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Today, GLINS provides a robust and practical framework for analyzing
      international logistics flows—including emerging routes such as Arctic
      shipping—and supporting evidence-based decisions. Its ongoing development
      continues to reflect both the complexities of global trade and the practical
      needs of the stakeholders who shape it.
